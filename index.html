					## Towards Functional Programming with Finagle @ ING Bank
					### How we started to use Finagle and how it opened the door for FP
				</section>

				<section>

					<section data-markdown>
						### Who am I
						* A committed Functional Programmer for 8 years, originally in Haskell and now in Scala. He is a Functional Programming evangelist at ING Bank where he maintains the core libraries and frameworks for the API Platform and trains colleagues in functional and reactive programming with Scala and Akka, and gets excited by opportunities to remove redundant code through abstraction.
						* Volleyball enthousiast, and referee
						* https://github.com/spockz
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						### Scala @ ING Bank
						- Multiple PoCs and products build on FP/Scala based technology, with Akka/Spray, Akka Clustering, Event-Sourcing
						- All technically sound solutions, however, somehow, they didn’t stick

						Note:
						- perhaps because of not enough developers and unfamiliarity with the code
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						### The 'breakthrough'
						* Battle on multiple fronts
						  * Gaining enough credits and kudos personally and for FP/Scala
						  * Exposure, exposure, exposure
						  * Move away from "Java vs Scala" discussion, the discussion is about paradigms instead of the latest hype

						Note:
						- 2+ years of advertisement
						- We will describe one of the latest PoC shortly
						- Personal credits/respect after rebuilding an application to save christmas
						- Credits to Scala/Akka/FP because
						    - using them was the only way we could’ve rebuild it so quickly and successfully
						    - of the quality of Finagle as discovered with the PoC
						- Raising the discussion from “Java vs Scala” to “we should use FP, which, btw, is easiest to do on existing infrastructure by using Scala”.
						    - Benefits for FP:
						        - Less state => easier to debug
						        - Immutability => easier to reason about applications
						            -  also easier to do parallelism

						## Proof of Concept

						Note:
						This is what gave us the 'permission' to keep doing scala
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						### Background
						* Current landscape consists of SOAP/XML over JMS. A SOAP operation per customer facing feature.
						* Drawbacks
							* Busses become critical for operation
							* Hard to maintain and to use find
						* Moving to "outside-in" designed APIs or microservices
						* Resiliency is paramount

						Note:
						- Current ING Landscape
						    - Many SOAP/JMS services exposed through multiple busses, almost every feature/page corresponds to a SOAP Service/Action
						- Drawbacks:
						    - Busses become SPOFs, and they have been somewhat unstable/overloaded, only so many connections possible per server.
						    - Lots of overhead due to SOAP/XML
						    - Hard to maintain by owners
						    - Hard to discover and consume by users
						- The usual reasons for moving to REST APIs and micro-services apply
						    - Smaller units: easier to maintain, use, and run (scale efficiently)
						    - Tradeoff: complexity in application traded for increase in communications / network complexity
						- The change:
						    - Moving to “outside-in” designed APIs, apis that focus on bundling data and functionality/experiences together based upon usage
						    - Removing the EMS
						    - Load balancing over dynamically discovered services
						    - Resiliency trumps performance
						        - We cannot use BackPressure because we have to work with legacy systems and 3rd party systems. BackPressure only works properly when used from the ground up
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
            ### Our Task
            - Create a “Resilient HTTP Client” to connect with and between APIS, which integrates / interfaces with existing ING Bank infrastructure:
                - Performance logging
                - Health logging
                - Security / Authentication
                - Service Discovery
                - Uniform Configuration
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
						- ‘easy’ to use
						- JVM 6+,
						- J2EE Independent
						- Requirement from the team
						    - We wanted to use our time efficiently and spent most of our time implementing ING Bank specific features.
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ### Research
            Existing Libraries and Clients
            - (Rx)Netty
            - Apache HTTP
            - Jersey Client
            - Ribbon / Spring Cloud
            - Finagle

            Note:
            - Choose to PoC between Ribbon and Finagle even though it was
              “suggested” to just use Ribbon as it would be familiar to
              developers because it uses RxJava and, moreover, because Hystrix
              was proven to work by and within our home-brew API Framework.
          </section>
				</section>
        <section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## PoC Results
            Note:
            - Disclaimer:
            - These findings are from april 2015, code and documentation may
              have changed. We also might just have missed things. The following
              is only intended to explain why Finagle works for us and does not
              represent any qualitative opinion about Ribbon.
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ### Service Discovery
            * Finagle: 1 morning
            * Ribbon: Multiple days
            Note:
            Integrating Finagle with the existing library took a single person
            one morning, including writing testcases. It took multiple days with
            multiple developers to do the same for Ribbon, in the end because of
            a ‘magic’ missing dependency from a seemingly unrelated artefact.
            Additionally, it was hard to figure out where to plugin our SD
            implementation in Ribbon as we had to reverse-engineer the
            source-code.
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ### Performance logging (todo)
            - Adding export of performance metrics to Graphite was as easy as adding a dependency to the class path.
            - It was hard to do for Ribbon, in the end it was possible by not using the default template, placing our class in a ribbon package and extending a ribbon class. Probably, this could have been done easier.
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ### Health logging (todo)
            - Was as easy as adding an Observer to the Observer filter or by adding a Filter, we choose to do the latter
            - Due to time constraints we didn’t get started at this
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ### Security / Authentication (todo)
            - As easy as adding a filter
            - Easily possible to add it to the template, however this wouldn’t be per-request, setting it up per-request proved to be very expensive.
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ### Performance and Reliability
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            #### Setup
            - 1 machine running Gatling talking to
            - 1 machine running production like setup (Tomcat 7 + Jersey + BIO adapter) talking to
            - 2-8 Spray instances running on one machine echoing the request and checking for auth. headers
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            #### Performance metrics (todo, add gatling screenshots)
            - 5500 vs 4200 (initially ±200-400) RPS
            - Finagle showed a smoother profile, with Ribbon we saw large GC cycles
            - Finagle had slightly lower response times
            - Less CPU utilisation when using Finagle, suggesting a different bottleneck

            Note:
            - Both use Netty in the end… so why the difference?
            - We didn't test all different sizes, especially only the smaller
              messages < 8kb
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            #### Reliability (todo, bulletpoint)
            Note:
            - Detection of failing instances (after kill of spray instance) was detected according to specs by both Finagle and Resilience
            - The Finagle solution could respond to change on pushes whereas the Ribbon solution could only poll resulting in changes only being picked up after 30 seconds. Nothing really wrong with that, just that ‘instantly’ is better.
            - Coming back up to full speed after instances where lost was hard for Ribbon (ToDo: Do we still have metrics / results for this?)
            - Ribbon distributed the load more evenly on low rps
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ### Maintainability
            Note:
            - Finagle’s community was and is very helpful on the mailing list and Gitter
            - Finagle is a generic RPC framework so, in contrast to Ribbon, it is re-usable for more than only the HTTP Client. This also makes it easy to re-use the integration with ING Bank infrastructure: our filters and SD integration.
            - There are several projects to integrate finagle with other things: Zookeeper, Redis, PostgreSQL, http, thrift, ..
            - Finagle’s code appears to me more mature, or at least more consistent
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ### Usability / User friendliness
            * Finagle's `Future` is new for most Java devs
              * `map`/`flatMap` are hard to use from pre Java 8


            Note:
            - - *Finagle* comes with its own `Future` type which is slightly different from the Scala version which isn’t bad per se. However, map/flatmap are hard to use from Java < 8
            - + *Ribbon* has nice ORM for mapping to services (https://github.com/Netflix/ribbon/blob/master/ribbon-examples/src/main/java/com/netflix/ribbon/examples/rx/proxy/RxMovieProxyExample.java)
            - + *Finagle* is very composable with Filters and Stacks (more on that later)
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ### Outcome
            * We choose *Finagle*
              * *Finagle* has shown good performance and reliability, it proved
                easy to maintain and extend by our team.
              * Pre Java 8 issues are mitigated by providing additional
                libraries.


            Note:
            - the reliability and performance. In the end several applications run virtualised on the same hardware so better resource utilisation is appreciated.
            - the maintainability
            - The drawbacks are mitigated by providing additional Java 7 interfaces and by making sure we can use Java 8+ in production in parallel

            ## Why *Finagle* was so easy to use

            Note:
            TL;DR: Finagle is very modular and easy to extend due to the
            application of Functional Programming principles and methods:
            composability over inheritance (ToDo: is it really a comparison?)
          </section>



          <section data-markdown>
            ### Short introduction
            * Based on [Your Service as a Function](http://monkey.org/~marius/funsrv.pdf) by [Marius Eriksen](http://monkey.org/~marius/)
            * Originated at Twitter and now used by a lot of companies (Foursquare, ING Bank, Pinterest, SoundCloud, Tumblr, Twitter)
            * Generic RPC Framework
              * Originally in FP style Java,
              * Now in Scala
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ### Main Components

            ```scala
            class Future[+A]
            ```

            ```scala
            class Service[-In, +Out]
              extends (Req) ⇒ Future[Rep]
            ```

            ```scala
            class Filter[-ReqIn, +RepOut, +ReqOut, -RepIn]
              extends (ReqIn, Service[ReqOut, RepIn]) ⇒ Future[RepOut]
            ```

            Note:
            - Future - Provides asynchronous execution
            - Service - Abstraction of services, function that takes input and generates a future output
            - Filter - components that are meant to be stacked on top of other Services and Filters
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ### `Var`
            ```scala
            trait Var[+T]
            ```

            Embodiment of something that can change, with a `map`, `flatMap`,
            and a `join` function. The essence here is that each reference to a
            `Var` itself is stable but its contents can change.

            ```scala
            @ val myVar = new ReadWriteVar(4)
            myVar: ReadWriteVar[Int] = Var(4)@241932831
            @ val dependentVar = myVar map (_ * 2)
            dependentVar: Var[Int] = com.twitter.util.Var$$anon$2@61845402
            @ dependentVar.sample
            res9: Int = 8
            @ myVar.update(21)

            @ dependentVar.sample
            res11: Int = 42
            ```
            Note:
            * `Var` resembles `Observable` from RxJava somewhat but isn't meant to
              be a collection. Therefore it has no `filter` methods
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ### `Name`
            Representing a service lookup, a `Name` is either `Bound` or a `Path`.
            * `Bound` consists of a `Var` of `Addr`
            * `Path` alias for a different path, changing the lookup
            * `Addr`
              * `Bound` - Concrete addresses,
              * `Failed` - Something went wrong,
              * `Neg` - Name could not be found,
              * `Pending` - Pending lookup,

            ```scala
            val boundAddr: Var[Addr] = new ReadWriteVar(Addr.Pending)
            val boundName = Name.Bound(boundAddr)
            boundAddr.update(Addr.Bound(new InetSocketAddress("google.com", 80)))
            ```

          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ### `Stack`
            - Uninstantied stack of filter to be, service factories, together with their configurations.
            - ToDo: Insert example of how to change FA config and how to replace the `Failure Accrual` as a whole
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ### Example: HTTP Call
            todo!
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ### Example: Adding Time-out
            todo1: with within()
            todo2: with filter
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>

            ## Wrapping up
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ### Finagle is not all roses (todo: bullet)
            * The default config are good for 80-99% of all use cases, but for optimal performance and resilience an intimate knowledge of both Finagle and the infrastructure is required. It also requires careful configuration according to the infrastructure. Which means that changes in infrastructure can lead to difficult changes in the config. The latter is being countered by using Goals, datatypes that describe what performance / resiliency is tried to be obtained. For more, see the RPC Redux talk (http://monkey.org/~marius/redux.html)
            * We had to build our own Java 7 interfaces, such as a HTTP Request Builder with support for JSON and such, but also because of the Scala type evidence didn’t really play nice with the Java compiler.
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ### Experience from teams
            * Mixed,
              * Just get it and fly off,
              * Just don't,
              * Few in between
            * Modularity is hard to teach:
              * Break things up in small functions and filters

            Note:
            Mixed - E.g. Some immediately grasp the possibilities, such as
            modularity and ease of testing, of Filter others just don’t. We
            haven’t found a way to explain Filters to them yet that sticks.
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ### Result
            - Teams are exposed to FP and Scala and are getting enthusiastic
            - We have a nice, integrated, HTTP client
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ### Future
            - We will look into giving Finagle training in addition to the Scala and Akka training already in place.
            - The API Platform team is looking into giving back to the community by open sourcing some of our tools and by giving back more to the Finagle project.
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            ## Conclusion
            1. Introducing new paradigms in large organisation takes a lot of time and good timing
            2. The discussion shouldn’t be Java vs Scala but on whether to move to the FP paradigm and the many benefits
            3. Use fact-based evidence to support your decisions
            4. Support from high(er)-management helps a lot
                * Creates room to do the first three points
                * Makes  other people more receptive to your story, sadly enough even with developers who should know better
